# AWS S3

### Overview

S3 bucket is used to store all images and webapp static files (custom css and JS scripts).
Static files are there, because it enables serving them via Content Delivery Network (CloudFront).

### Folder structure

    .
    ├── imgages     # Full resolution images
    ├── static      # Static webapp files
    └── thumbnails  # 150 x 150px thumbnails

### Security

Bucket has **Block all public access** enabled. 
Files are accessible either publicly with **CloudFront** (Read-Only) or 
privately with my **AWS account roles** (Read, Write and Delete).

### Lambda trigger

When a new image is uploaded to **images/** (i.e. a new message is posted) directory, 
then ImgScaler **"Create Thumbnail"** function is triggered. Thumbnails are put to **thumbnails/** folder.
